# AspireSync

AspireSync is designed to enumerate and download the plugins and themes stored in the WordPress SVN repository and
Content Delivery Network.

## Features

* Download themes and plugins from the WordPress .org repository and upload them to local or S3 storage.
* Store metadata and other information about every version of every plugin.
* Download the latest version of a plugin/theme, or all versions, or a subset.
* Handles closed and not found plugins/themes.
* Updates only those items that are updated in SVN, so you don't have to pull the entire dataset.
* Supports Postgres out of the box for metadata retention (SQLite coming eventually)
* Runs downloads in parallel tasks (24 max) to allow for speedy download of assets.

## Quick Start

AspireSync requires a running instance of [AspireCloud](https://github.com/AspirePress/AspireCloud).  Simply clone it and start it up with `make init`.

Once you have AspireCloud started, start the AspireSync service by running `meta/bin/bootstrap`

Get a shell by typing `make run`.  Once in the shell, type `aspiresync` without arguments for help.

## Configuration

### Database

AspireSync makes use of a Postgres database for storing information about each asset it pulls. These configuration
values are **required**.

| Env Variable | Description                                    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| DB_USER      | The username for the database                  |
| DB_PASS      | The password for the database                  |
| DB_NAME      | Name of the database to insert the information |
| DB_HOST      | The hostname of the database                   |
| DB_SCHEMA    | The schema in the database to use              |

### Uploads

AspireSync also uploads files to a location of your choosing, either in S3(-compatible) storage or local storage
somewhere on disk.

You can configure the following enviornment variables to determine where uploads are placed.

| Env Variable          | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UPLOAD_ASSETS_ADAPTER | Which adapter to use for file system uploads (current options are `upload_local_filesystem` or `upload_aws_s3`)                                             |
| UPLOAD_DIR            | The fully qualified directory path to upload files into if UPLOAD_ASSETS_ADAPTER is set to `upload_local_filesystem`                                        |
| AWS_BUCKET            | The bucket to use for Amazon S3 uploads                                                                                                                     |

| AWS_S3_ENDPOINT       | This is a hard-coded bucket endpoint, useful for S3-compatible storage. This is not a required parameter and will default to `null`                         |
| AWS_S3_KEY            | For users of access keys with AWS IAM, this is the access key. If this is not provided, the client will attempt authenticaton through an attached IAM role. |
